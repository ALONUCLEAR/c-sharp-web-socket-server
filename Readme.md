## Summary
This is a web socket server created in c#, cause I've long wanted to do a simple project with websockets, and I wanted to improve my c# knowledge in more areas than just my typical gamedev, wpf or console applications.

## Port changing
Make sure that if you change the port, you do it both in <code>program.cs</code> and in launchSettings.json's <code>applicationUrl</code>
